"""
This module contains the machinery handling assumptions.

All symbolic objects have assumption attributes that can be accessed via
.is_<assumption name> attribute.

Assumptions determine certain properties of symbolic objects. Assumptions
can have 3 possible values: True, False, None.  None is returned when it is
impossible to say something about the property. For example, a generic Symbol
is not known beforehand to be positive.

By default, all symbolic values are in the largest set in the given context
without specifying the property. For example, a symbol that has a property
being integer, is also real, complex, etc.

Here follows a list of possible assumption names:

    - commutative   - object commutes with any other object with
                        respect to multiplication operation.
    - real          - object can have only values from the set
                        of real numbers
    - integer       - object can have only values from the set
                        of integers
    - bounded       - object absolute value is bounded
    - positive      - object can have only positive values
    - negative      - object can have only negative values
    - nonpositive      - object can have only nonpositive values
    - nonnegative      - object can have only nonnegative values
    - irrational    - object value cannot be represented exactly by Rational
    - unbounded     - object value is arbitrarily large
    - infinitesimal - object value is infinitesimal


Implementation note: assumption values are stored in
._assumptions dictionary or are returned by getter methods (with
property decorators) or are attributes of objects/classes.

    Find the truth value for a property of an object.

    This function is called when a request is made to see what a fact
    value is.

    For this we use several techniques:

    First, the fact-evaluation function is tried, if it exists (for
    example _eval_is_integer). Then we try related facts. For example

        rational   -->   integer

    another example is joined rule:

        integer & !odd  --> even

    so in the latter case if we are looking at what 'even' value is,
    'integer' and 'odd' facts will be asked.

    In all cases, when we settle on some fact value, its implications are
    deduced, and the result is cached in ._assumptions.
